## Data-Science-Project
The project is based on Prediction Model which, with the use of the model designed,  predicts whether the customers of a bank will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

The project can be broken down into 4 different parts:
1. Importing Dataset
2. Exploratory Analysis:
   A. Univariate Analysis
   B. Bivariate Analysis
   C. Coorelation Analysis
3. Model Building and Accuracy Check using Logistic Regression Algorithm.
4. Model Building and Accuracy Check using Decision Tree Algorithm.

The dataset has been provided by Internshala Training on Data Science.
